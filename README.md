# Intelligent Transport Arrival Prediction System

My Final year dissertation developing an intelligent transport arrival prediction system for Travel for London (TFL) transport service using historical data with Data Visualisation and Machine Learning techniques

• Created a dataset from scratch using TFLs open data from its Unified API service

• Pre-Processed the data by cleaning and integrating it using Pandas Library in Python

• Used Seaborn library in python to visualize the data and analyse any patterns and similarities

• Worked with Machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and Keras to create Recurrent Neural networks (Long Short-Term Memory) and ARIMA (Statistical) Time Series Models
